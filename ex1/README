Assignment 1:
The program WhatIDo creates a new folder called "Welcome", creates inside it another folder called
"TO", and then opens in it the file "OS2020" with the flags "O_WRONLY" (write only), "O_CREAT"
(create the file if it doesn't exist) and "O_TRUNC" (if the file does exists and can be writen on,
it will be truncated to length 0). It then checks if the file was created successfully, and writes
a message on it. The program then closes the file and deletes it, the folder "To" and the folder
"Welcome" and exits.
